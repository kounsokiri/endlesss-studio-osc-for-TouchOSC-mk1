# :control_knobs: Control **Endlesss Studio** with your iPad and TouchOSC

I'm a huge fan of [Endlesss](https://endlesss.fm). I play a lot on my phone, but I needed a dedicated controller to get the same experience on desktop. I've been interested in [TouchOSC](https://hexler.net/touchosc) for a while, and thought this would make a fun project to *kill two birds with one stone*.

:no_mobile_phones: I made this for use with an iPad Pro 12.9". This controller has a [Creative Commons license](https://github.com/renderghost/endlesss-studio-osc/blob/main/LICENSE) so feel free to resize it to your device, or do whatever else you want with it. Just don't sell it. I'd love to see what you come up with.

If you have ideas for changes, please :bulb: [start a discussion](https://github.com/renderghost/endlesss-studio-osc/discussions)
